# Tribes & Empires

This is an attempt at defining a simple game inspired by the paper [War, space, and the evolution olf Old World complex societies](docs/war-space-evolution-societies.pdf), by Turchin et al.
Each player plays the role of a tribe whose goal is to survive throughout the game, either growing as a political entity or evading other political entities.
